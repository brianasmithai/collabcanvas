**Deferred to Future Work:**
- [ ] **Live transform visualization during drag/resize/rotate**  
  Currently, transforms only propagate after completion. Real-time visualization of transformations as they happen is deferred due to complexity.
- [ ] **Real-time transform streaming for non-selected objects**  
  Only selected objects stream to RTDB; passive observation of other users' active transforms is deferred.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Performance Targets (from PRD)
- **Object Sync**: Sub-100ms latency for shape transformations
- **Cursor Sync**: Sub-50ms latency for cursor positions  
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS during all interactions
- **Scalability**: Support 500+ objects with 5+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Zero visible lag during rapid multi-user edits

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Advanced Conflict Resolution**: Implement CRDT or Operational Transform for better conflict handling
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Add offline mode with sync on reconnection
- [ ] **Performance Analytics**: Detailed performance metrics and user behavior tracking
- [ ] **Multi-Shape Transformations**: Simultaneous resize/rotate of multiple objects

---

### Notes & Conventions
- Keep tests **surgical**: verify wiring/behavior, not library internals
- Prefer **hook and utility tests** over heavy canvas interactions  
- Performance tests should include real-world scenarios with multiple users
- All real-time operations must maintain sub-100ms latency targets
