# Product Requirements Document: Real-Time Shape Synchronization Optimization

## Introduction/Overview

This feature optimizes the CollabCanvas application's real-time collaboration performance by implementing a hybrid data storage strategy. Currently, all shape operations (create, move, resize, rotate, delete) are stored directly in Firestore, causing performance bottlenecks during rapid transformations. This leads to sluggish drag operations, failed rotations/resizes, and poor scalability with 500+ objects.

The goal is to implement a dual-storage approach where real-time shape transformations are handled by Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB) for instant synchronization, while final states are persisted in Firestore for durability.

## Goals

1. **Performance Optimization**: Achieve sub-100ms object sync and sub-50ms cursor sync as specified in the project rubric
2. **Smooth Interactions**: Eliminate sluggish drag operations and failed rotations/resizes
3. **Scalability**: Support 500+ objects with 5+ concurrent users without performance degradation
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Enable instant shape transformations visible to all users
5. **Data Persistence**: Maintain final shape states in Firestore for durability and reconnection

## User Stories

### Primary Users (All Collaborators)
- **As a collaborator**, I want to see shape changes in real-time so that I don't conflict with others' work
- **As a user**, I want smooth drag operations so that the interface feels responsive and professional
- **As a designer**, I want to resize and rotate shapes without lag so that I can work efficiently
- **As a team member**, I want to see other users' transformations instantly so that we can collaborate effectively

### Secondary Users (Developers/Testers)
- **As a developer**, I want comprehensive testing tools so that I can verify performance with 500+ objects
- **As a tester**, I want latency monitoring so that I can ensure we meet performance targets
- **As a maintainer**, I want clear conflict resolution so that the system handles edge cases gracefully

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Real-Time Transform Synchronization
1.1. The system must synchronize shape position (x, y) changes in real-time during drag operations
1.2. The system must synchronize shape size (width, height) changes in real-time during resize operations
1.3. The system must synchronize shape rotation changes in real-time during rotate operations
1.4. The system must handle resize anchor points (which corner/side is being resized)
1.5. All real-time transformations must be visible to all connected users within 100ms
1.6. **CRITICAL**: Live transforms must be applied to visual shapes in real-time, not just final states
1.7. **CRITICAL**: Users must see other users' shapes moving/resizing/rotating as they happen

### 2. Hybrid Storage Architecture
2.1. The system must store real-time transformations in Firebase Realtime Database
2.2. The system must persist final shape states in Firestore after operation completion
2.3. The system must implement a transform pipeline: RTDB → Firestore
2.4. The system must handle network disconnections gracefully during transformations
2.5. The system must maintain data consistency between RTDB and Firestore

### 3. Conflict Resolution
3.1. The system must use Last-Write-Wins (LWW) strategy for simultaneous edits
3.2. The system must handle multiple users editing the same shape simultaneously
3.3. The system must provide clear visual feedback on edit conflicts
3.4. The system must prevent "ghost" objects or duplicates during rapid edits
3.5. The system must handle 10+ changes per second without state corruption

### 4. Performance Optimization
4.1. The system must support 500+ objects without FPS drops
4.2. The system must support 5+ concurrent users without performance degradation
4.3. The system must maintain 60 FPS during all interactions
4.4. The system must throttle high-frequency updates appropriately
4.5. The system must handle bulk operations (selecting/moving 500 objects)

### 5. Testing and Debugging
5.1. The system must provide a debug button to create N objects (configurable count)
5.2. The system must provide bulk selection capability for testing
5.3. The system must include latency monitoring with warnings (non-blocking)
5.4. The system must provide connection status indicators
5.5. The system must log performance metrics for analysis

### 6. Network Resilience
6.1. The system must handle network disconnections during transformations
6.2. The system must revert to pre-transformation state on network failure
6.3. The system must treat network disconnection as "release grip" operation
6.4. The system must maintain final states in Firestore for reconnection
6.5. The system must provide clear UI feedback for connection status

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Backward Compatibility**: No need to maintain compatibility with existing Firestore-only data

- **Backup Systems**: No fallback to alternative real-time databases
- **Historical Data**: No version history or undo/redo functionality

## Design Considerations

### Data Flow Architecture
- **Real-time Path**: User interaction → RTDB → All clients (instant)
